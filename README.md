# Fridgify

Welcome to Fridgify, an online refrigerator where you can inventory what's in your actual fridge.

## Overview

This is Fridgify, your one stop spot for what's in your fridge. Have you ever been at a party and wanted to know if you had Kraft singles in your fridge to make grilled cheese when you get home? Well now you will! With Fridgify, you'll have a visual fridge interface to add the name, quantity, expiration date of anything in your fridge, and categorize them by food group and fridge or freezer. You'll never forget where you left that slice of ham again! 

### Features
- Create, update, or delete Items with Name,  Quantity, Exp. Date, Categories and Fridge or Freezer
- See groupings of what is where in your fridge
- All content that is created/saved shows up immediately, without page refresh
- Application is usable on mobile

What we've like to add:
- Animations for multiple interactions throughout the site
- Food authors so people can keep track of who's food
- Authentication for multiple users
- Adding your own categories
